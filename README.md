-Each person is  first registered to the database with their pictures
-After the registeration, the webcam captures their faces 
-When their face are captuered, if the attendance is valid, their information will be stored on a database in microsoft exel

# HOW TO REGISTER A NEW FACE
A face can be registered by simply placing their picture in the faceAttendance folder

# note

this is done in pycharm and all the dependencies must be installed in order to get it to work
